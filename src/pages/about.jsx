          Hi! I'm <span className="font-semibold">Ameera Nihar</span>. I lived in
          Kolkata until 2022, after which I moved to Manchester, UK. From a young age,
          I was always inquisitive about food and cuisines, which sparked my journey
          into cooking and exploring recipes from around the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          My roots are from Chennai, so there was always a place in my heart for
          every flavor, every dish. Over time, cooking became my way to express
          creativity, curiosity, and culture.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my page <span className="font-semibold">Everyday Cravings üç¥</span>, I
          capture a piece of my soul in every recipe. Every day is a new search within,
          a new flavor to explore, and a story to share.
        </p>

        <p className="text-maroon font-semibold">
          Join me on this journey of flavors, curiosity, and everyday cravings!
